# Memorize 
The objective of the game is to match all pairs of cards on the game board. Each card has a symbol on its face, and the game board consists of a grid of cards. Players can choose to flip over two cards at a time, and if the symbols on those cards match, they remain face up. If the symbols do not match, the cards are flipped back over and players can try again. The game is won when all pairs of cards have been matched.
